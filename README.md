## 📖 Overview  
This project analyzes a pizza sales dataset to answer real business questions and discover meaningful patterns. SQL was used to write and execute queries at different levels (basic, intermediate, and advanced), while Excel was used to clean the data and create visual dashboards for better understanding.

## 💡 Business Problem  
The main objectives of this project are to:  
- Identify the best and worst-selling pizzas  
- Understand how much revenue each pizza and category contributes  
- Discover customer ordering patterns (sizes, categories, time of day)  
- Track revenue growth over time  
- Provide insights that can support menu design, pricing, and marketing decisions
